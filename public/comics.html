 <h2>The saga of the Loopy Woopy Flat  </h2>
 It's a bunch of computer generated characters doing normal stuff weirdly. 
    The name is from the name of the script I used when making it. The exact thought I 
    had was what could be the most idiotic , stupid , dumbass name I could think of when 
    naming this useless script and here we are.

  <h2>Great Scott! I'm doing a time-travel comic
  </h2>
  The newest and first comic we have on the works is time travelling bicycle ,I've been thinking of this idea for a while and I really wanted to do it to fix some of the movie timetravel problems no one seems to sort. Look out for a sample soon on the site.

    <h3>Time Travelling bicycle #1</h3>
    Time travelling Bicycle! Starring J.J and Matt , it's not long but it took me much more time than it should've. 
  The quality is not the best but hopefully it'll get better.
    This is the first 5 comic pages the Thunder Cloud comics team has ever made, click below to download.<br> 
    <a href="issue1.zip">
      <button class="btn"><i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download</button></a>
  </div>
  <div class="threebies">
    <h3>Time Travelling bicycle #2</h3>
   Issue 2 is where time travelling actually comes in which I am guessing is what most people were waiting for.
   It's still done on paper because I haven't got the digital stuff yet but don't worry , it might still be bareable to read. <br>

<h2>New plant based comic</h2>
Alot of comics are things I've thought about for years and years. Things I daydream about, and this is no exception.
The comic is set in Modern day northen Ireland like we are (because I'm creative) and it focuses on the 5 main characters; 
Evan, Flo, Dee, Tam and Luci. I don't want to pick favourites , but like my parents I will and its Flo. I've been thinking about 
every aspect of Flo for years and they were in one of my stories I wrote as a kid and I liked them so much that I added them 
into this comic. Flo is a sentient plant person who has been running the same top florist for a few hundred years. They are simple minded and
pleasant and are already my favourite , so if you know which character gets more development , I think we both know what's up.
<br><br>
Anyways more on the actual comic, the writer will be me, but you don't know who I am so that's kinda pointless and
the artist is also someone you don't know, so I hope you're all clued in. The plot is a battle againist the forces of evil
namely Luci's siblings. The team will have to defeat every single one to stop the family business taking over the earth. I don't know 
how many siblings to put in but I hope it's not 7 because I would definitely ripping off Scott Pligrim (If you don't know what that is, 
it's the best comic ever and I would proabably monetize this site just to buy the card game) Anyways more updates and comics coming soon 
and you might see an issue of whatever this comic will be called soon.<br><br>So yeah look out for that please. Thanks.
