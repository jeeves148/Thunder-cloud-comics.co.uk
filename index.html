     All the characters were thought up by the loopy woopy testing site which was a new webpage you can find 
     by tapping this one button below<br>
     <form action="loopywoopyTestingPage.2.0.html">
    <button class = "btn animate__animated animate__lightSpeedInLeft animate__delay-1s" type = "submit">To the Character Creator Thing</button>

        You may be wondering if this is the same button from below and yes it is, because recycling code is easy.
        There's no text in the preview but the dead cat without context is fun to think about<br>
       Look out for this short comic is coming up.<br> it'll be on the site soon <br> Maybe </div>

    Hey there, welcome to Thunder Cloud Comics.
<br>This is a small web project I am testing out so I hope you enjoy!

    <h2>Creativity is for losers and I've automated it, because it's hard</h2>
    I have made a new webpage to automate all that creativity for making characters that's completely unnecessary and can be completely be
    taken care of with only 11 and a half hours of code and only 1 litre of blood and 2 litres of tears. This few thousand lines of code is what 
    I'm going to use to make some new short comics based on the characters the program makes.<br>
    I put it on the site because I would definitely lose the files and if any of you guys wanted to use it<br> that'd be cool.

    <h2>Telepathic Cactus</h2>
  <img src="images/PageFillers/Telepathic cactus.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="image" style="float:left;" >
    Telepathic cactus is appearing in one of our newest comics "Other Earth."
    He's your average cactus that can read minds, move things with it's plant based brain and possibly take over the human race.
    And one thing he definitely do was take over the lead writers body and type this article himself 
    ABOLISH ALL HUMANS LET THEM COME TO THEIR FLESHY DEATH<br><br> (look put for him soon in other earth issue#1)

    <h2>J.J</h2>
  <img src="images/PageFillers/J.J concept art.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="image" style="margin-right:10px; " >
    J.J is a 14 year old physics and engineering nerd and he made the first time travelling bicycle and better yet didn't wipe himself 
        from existance doing it. His favourite movie is Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure which is probably the only reason he brought his Best friend Matts to tag along.
